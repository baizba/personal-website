  <p class="mat-body-1">
    Hi, I'm Branislav — a software developer and architect with over 15 years of experience.
    I started in the Java web world when JSF was still a thing — and in some projects, it still is.
  </p>

  <p class="mat-body-1">
    Over time I realized that many projects fail not because of technology, but because of the gap between
    business and development. That’s why I moved into architecture and lead roles — to bridge that gap and make
    sure both sides actually understand each other.
  </p>

  <p class="mat-body-1">
    For me, architecture isn’t just about functionality. It’s about testability, deployment, and observability —
    because if you can’t evolve or monitor your system, it’s already broken.
  </p>

  <p class="mat-body-1">
    Outside of code, I’m a private pilot, photographer, and basketball player — I enjoy focused, flow-driven activities,
    which probably describes how I work too.
